              Sometimes movies are more complicated than four-volume novels. But
              you learn to read books in school, but you don't learn to watch
              movies.And without preparation, it can be difficult to enjoy
              watching a movie.

              In this 8-session course we will learn how to be conscious
              viewers. We will get acquainted with the stages of film production
              and learn how to watch a movie through the eyes of a screenwriter,
              director and editor. We will understand genres and look at the
              most important films, from Citizen Kane to The Matrix.
